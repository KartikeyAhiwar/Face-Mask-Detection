# Face Mask Detection Using AI

This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect if a person is wearing a face mask in real-time video feeds.

## Features
- Real-time face mask detection.
- Trained using a dataset of images with and without masks.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download or collect a dataset with images of people with and without masks.
4. Train the model using `train_model.py`.
5. Run the real-time detection with `face_mask_detection.py`.

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
